## Initial Setup
```{r initial setup}
FREQUENCY <- 10000 # Hz (cycles/s)
PERIOD <- 1/FREQUENCY # (s/cycle)
MAX_CAPACITANCE <- 193e-12 # (F)
OPTIMAL_RESISTANCE <- PERIOD / (10 * MAX_CAPACITANCE)
```
According to the spec sheet of the humidity sensor, the optimal frequency and the maximum capacitance (which is at 100% relative humidity) are 10kHz and 193pF, respectively. To find the right resistance value for the CR circuit used in the experiment, the frequency was first converted to period. Now, knowing that the spikes from the capacitor needs to decay within half the square wave period and that it takes about 5 times the CR time constant to fully decay, the following relationship was employed, where $T$ is the period of the square wave and $C$ is the max capacitance of the humidity sensor.
\begin{equation}
  R_{optimal} = \frac{1}{2}T*\frac{1}{5C} \\
\end{equation}
With the equation above and the given condition, the resulting resistance value was about $51.8k\Omega$. Therefore, the resistor closest to the desired rating, which was a $49.9k\Omega$ resistor, was used.

## Circuit Diagram and Photo
```{r Circuit Photo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Photo of the circuit", size = 5, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/circuit_photo.jpg")
```

```{r Circuit Diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Circuit Diagram", size = 5, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/circuit_diagram.jpg")
```

## Circuit Output in OScope
```{r Circuit Output, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Voltage measurement on the OScope", size = 5, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/oscope_result.png")
```

The figure above shows the voltage input from the wave generator and the voltage output in the CR circuit. As intended, half a period of the square wave is equal to about $5RC$ to let the capacitor charge and discharge fully.

## Plot of RH vs V

  capacitance <- (voltage - 201.5) / 1.977
  return(capacitance)

## Humidity in the Lab
```{r Humidity Sensor Measurement}
ROOM_RH_V <- 540
ROOM_RH <- func_RH(func_VtoC(540))
paste("Relative Humidity in the Lab:", round(ROOM_RH, digits = 1), "%")
```
The relative humidity of the lab was calculated to be around 26.7%. Considering that a comfortable indoor RH is between 30-50% and the buildings have been dry due to the heating, the value seems reasonable. Additionally, the RH value in the lab from a digital sensor device showed about 20% on Feb 24, 2023 with dry weather outside. The calculated value from the experiment was higher than this value but the snowfall/sleet from the day of the experiment might have increased the RH a little bit. If the experiment was conducted over multiple days with a variety of weather conditions, the results of the humidity sensor could be further validated.

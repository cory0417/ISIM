### Introduction

To measure heartbeat from the slight recoil of the weighing scale with a person standing on it, I first put an amplifier with a gain of 101, then two band pass filters in series with a gain of -10 and cutoff frequencies of 0.5 Hz to 16 Hz. Finally, the voltage signal was filtered with a second order low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 16 Hz. 

### Circuit

#### Circuit Schematic

```{r Circuit Schematic, out.width="50%", out.extra='style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/circuit_schematic.jpg")
```

#### Circuit on Breadboard

```{r Circuit, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.extra='style="transform:rotate(90deg); display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/circuit.jpg")

```

#### Circuit with Weighing Scale

```{r Circuit with Scale, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.extra='style="transform:rotate(270deg); display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/circuit_scale.jpg")
```


```{r LoadData, message=FALSE}
df_bandpass <- read_csv("data/bode_bandpass.csv")
df_lowpass <- read_csv("data/bode_lowpass.csv")
df_bcg <- read_csv("data/BCG.csv")
```

### Bode Plots

```{r Bode Plot Bandpass}
df_bandpass %>% 
  ggplot(aes(freq, gain)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "Bode Plot of Bandpass Filter",
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Gain (dB)",
    caption = "The bode plot shows the gain of a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.5 Hz and 16 Hz."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)
  )

```

```{r Bode Plot Lowpass}
df_lowpass %>% 
  ggplot(aes(freq, gain)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "Bode Plot of Second Order Lowpass Filter",
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Gain (dB)",
    caption = "The bode plot shows the gain of the second order lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 16 Hz."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)
  )
```

### BCG Trace

```{r}
df_bcg %>% 
  select(t1, ch1) %>% 
  mutate(
    t1 = t1 - t1[1]
    ) %>% 
  rename(
    time = t1,
    voltage = ch1
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, voltage)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Ballistocardiograph",
    x = "Time (s)",
    y = "Voltage (V)",
    caption = "The plot above shows the pulse as a person stands on the weighing scale."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)
  )

#### Performance

The range finder works surprisingly well but with some caveats. The errors were at most about 2.2 inches -- all data points from the range finder were within 1-2 inches from the actual distances. The trend within the distances measured by the range finder seems visually very linear as well, just slightly larger than the actual distance. 

While the data collection was done using a solid wall to bounce off the ultrasonic waves, the device did not perform as well on less reflective surfaces, such as fluffy cotton fabric. Furthermore, there was some human error involved in deciding when the receiver's blip began since the blips did not have a very sharp change. It was especially difficult at shorter distances since the initial blip merged with the wave that actually represented the receiver status. There was a similar phenomenon at distances that were larger than 10 ft where the blips, again, started to merge and interfere with each other, and it became challenging to read which signal represented the receiver. 

It's not possible to definitively conclude on the accuracy of the range finder with merely 5 data points collected. But if I had to, I would generally trust the distances measured from the range finder in the range between 2-10 ft, with an understanding that the range finder tends to give slightly longer distances, and that it may be off by few inches.

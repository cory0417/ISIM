### Introduction

#### Circuit Design

```{r Circuit Schematic, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/circuit.png")
```

The voltage output from the blood pressure sensor goes through a circuit that has a second-order high pass filter with a cutoff frequency at about 0.16 Hz, then an op amp with a gain of 26, and finally a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency at about 24.11 Hz. 

##### 2.5 V as Reference Voltage
The 2.5 V as the reference for the high pass filters and the op amp allows the op amp to be able to return a meaningful voltage value for all range of the input voltage. The voltage input to the op amp from the high-pass filters will now be all positive values since it will now be centered about 2.5 V, instead of being centered about 0 V. If the reference voltage was at 0 V, the op amp wouldn't have been able to return meaningful values for input voltages that were below 0 V. 


```{r Circuit Setup - Cutoff Frequency}
# CR filters:
# Capacitor: 1 microF
# Resistor: 1 Mohm
# 
# RC filter:
# Resistor: 2kohm
# Capacitor: 3.3microF

CR <- 1e-6*1e6
RC <- 2e3*3.3e-6

F_CR <- 1/(2*pi*CR)
F_RC <- 1/(2*pi*RC)

df_cutoff_f <- 
  tibble(
  F_CR,
  F_RC
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "filter_type"),
    names_sep = ("_"),
    cols = everything()
  ) %>% 
  rename(
    'cutoff_frequency' = F
  )

df_cutoff_f
```


```{r Circuit Setup - Gain}
gain <- 1 + 100e3/4e3
paste("The gain of the op amp is", gain)
